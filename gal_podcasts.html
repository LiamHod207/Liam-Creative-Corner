          <h3>"Who's the Class Clown Now?"</h3>
          <p>"Who's the Class Clown Now?", or Class Clown for short, is a small comedic interview podcast series about the host (me) interviewing other students around the school! As of now there are two podcasts, one with MK about transfering to another school, and with Marcus about Boys Club.</p>
          <p>This podcast has showed me how to clean audio and create scripts for interviews. As well as building my confidence to talk to more people and get use to my voice.</p>
